## CS50 Winter 2021, Tiny Search Engine

##Implementation
I implemented a crawler, indexer, and querier.
Crawler output a text file containing each webpage's URL, HTML, and given unique ID
Indexer took the crawler input and created 

Querier was able to run crawler and indexer when the user input a search command. 
I just chose to breakdown the problem by first creating crawler, then indexer, and finally querier because this proccess was 
the overview we were explained in class about the basics of how bigger search engines function.
